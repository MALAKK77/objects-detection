# objects-detection
This project implements real-time object detection using Python and OpenCV.   It uses a pre-trained deep learning model (SSD MobileNet V3) that can recognize more than 80 everyday objects such as people, cars, animals, furniture, and electronic devices.    The program captures live video from your computerâ€™s webcam, processes each frame, and detects objects by drawing bounding boxes and labels on the screen.   It also applies Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to improve accuracy by removing duplicate or overlapping detections.    The system is lightweight and runs in real-time on CPU, making it suitable for learning, experimentation, and small-scale projects in computer vision.
